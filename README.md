CAPTCHA RECOGNITON USING CNN


DATASET ---> 


** Captcha generation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves training a model to recognize characters within images and generate captchas that are challenging for 
automated systems to solve.

** The project typically begins with collecting a dataset of various font styles, sizes, and backgrounds to create diverse captcha samples.

** CNNs are then employed to extract features from these captcha images, enabling the model to learn the patterns and variations of characters.

** Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and noise addition may be applied to increase the diversity of training data and improve the model's robustness.

** Once trained, the CNN model can generate new captchas with random characters and backgrounds, contributing to enhanced security measures against automated attacks on 
web applications.
